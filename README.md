This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary

Quick React App made to compare two users Spotify libraries / artists for a final project in a cloud computing course. Uses Oauth to authenticate, and hits an API Gateway that invokes a Lambda as the backend.

On the webapp code is contained in this repo, perhaps further improvement coming.
